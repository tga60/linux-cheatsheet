Linux Command Cheatsheet
Overview
This project is an interactive Linux command cheatsheet designed to help users quickly learn and reference common terminal commands. It presents categorized command lists with descriptions, making it easy to navigate and use.

The cheatsheet is implemented as a single-page HTML file with built-in interactivity, including features like section toggling and search filtering—all without requiring external scripts or frameworks.

Features
🧠 Categorized commands: Grouped into logical sections like File Management, Process Control, Network, etc.

🔍 Search functionality: Instantly filter commands as you type.

📚 Expandable sections: Click to show or hide details, keeping the interface clean.

📦 Self-contained: No external dependencies—just open the HTML file in a browser.

How Claude AI Was Used
The core content and structure of this project were generated using Claude AI (Anthropic's AI assistant), which played a key role in:

✍️ Compiling and categorizing commands: Claude AI generated a comprehensive list of common Linux commands, organized them into meaningful categories, and provided concise explanations.

🧱 Designing the layout: The structure of the HTML, including the toggle behavior and styling, was AI-assisted to ensure ease of use and clarity.

🎯 Optimizing user experience: Claude AI proposed usability enhancements such as collapsible sections, semantic headings, and search input to increase the value of the cheatsheet as a practical tool.

This project showcases how generative AI can accelerate the creation of technical documentation and interactive tools by synthesizing best practices, generating code, and optimizing content organization.
